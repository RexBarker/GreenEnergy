# GreenEnergy

## Background
The analysis of the German Energy market using Big Data.  

- Infrastructure: utilization of Big data methodlogies (Docker, Kafka, InfluxDB, Jupyter notebook, Python)
- Analysis : focuses on the prediction of conventional power plant operation considering the influence of solar and wind power

## Synopsis
The topic of climate change pervades our daily lives in terms of how we live, grow, and prepare for the future.  Moreover, our ever-increasing energy demand forces us to consider the energy sources as a primary factor in terms of climate change.  In the European energy market, the drive for clean and sustainable energy has led to a strong market for renewable sources - primarily in terms of solar and wind power.  Conversely, the demand for conventional energy production via fossil-fuel and nuclear sources has been declining.  For the energy market investor, the future profitability of new and existing fossil-fuel power plants must be considered before placing significant investments.  For the energy producer, the profitability of a coal or gas power plant must be considered for daily operation.

Any energy market cannot, however consist of only renewable energy sources -- the uncertainty in their energy production still requires the contribution of conventional sources.  Additionally, the recent advances in energy storage allow the use of excess power to pump water into storage dams for later use.  For the fossil fuel power plant operator, this leads to the question of daily operation: “should the plant operate today or not, based on required load, forecast weather, and energy price?”.
